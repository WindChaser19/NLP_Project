NLP (6.461) project code

Code is in `dual_hirope_eval_submit.py`. Fixed blocking is implemented by running with argument --dual as "block" and semantic positions is ran with --dual as "dual". Specify the positional scheme with --rope as "hirope", "sumrope" or "sumhirope" , and the model size as --model with value "Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B" ""Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B" or "Qwen/Qwen3-4B" . We ran with --n as 100 (number of samples).
